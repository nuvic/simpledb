# SimpleDB

This is an implementation of Edward Sciore's [SimpleDB](https://cs.bc.edu/~sciore/simpledb/) system, which is part of his book Database Design and Implementation.

The original code was written in Java. I rewrote it in Rust to practice.

For each chapter's implementation, I will wrote a short blog post summarizing some of the important design decisions.
